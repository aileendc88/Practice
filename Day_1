/*using the flattened me array create an object called Myself. The properties are the value types. i.e.: name: "Ryan"*/


/*finally, create a callback function that is to be used after the Myself object is created. The callback will introduce you by printing "Hello World! I am [nameHere]". The callback function is named meMyselfAndI*/
